## Getting started

Executing a `yarn` command should perform all necessary steps to develop the module, if it does not then follow the steps below.

The module can be built once with `yarn build`. This should be enough to get the module to be loadable by companion.

While developing the module, by using `yarn dev` the compiler will be run in watch mode to recompile the files on change.
